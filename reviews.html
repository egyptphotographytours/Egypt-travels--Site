                    <p class="review-text">“Hossam provided a magnificent tour of the Giza Pyramids and the surrounding area. Hossam was always thoughtful, communicative, knowledgeable, and molded the tour accordingly to what you’d want to do. Not only did he show me around the Giza pyramids, but after he adjusted his schedule to also do one of the Museums as well! From the start to finish, Hossam did an amazing job. Glad I booked this tour and made a new friend in Hossam!”</p>

                    <p class="review-text">“Muy bien la sesión, me gustó mucho que los spots son sin gente. Tuve que reservar este tour porque hice uno anteriormente y las fotos fueron muy malas. Ahora bien, solo consideren que hay que pagar un costo extra por el camello y las entradas al recinto (lo cual lo especifica en el post del anuncio)”</p>

                    <p class="review-text">“프라이빗 투어로 남편과 둘이서 투어 참가했는데, 관광객이 많지 않은 좋은 스팟으로 안내해줘서 멋진 사진 많이 건질 수 있었어요! 사진 촬영뿐 아니라 피라미드나 스핑크스에 대한 간단한 역사 이야기도 해줘서 더 유익했습니다☺️ 카이로 토박이 출신이라 추천할 만한 레스토랑이나 스팟들도 많이 알려줬고, 비싸기만 한 곳은 비추해주기도 해서 이집트에 처음 오는 입장에서 여행에 많은 도움이 된 것 같아요 간단한 스토리텔링 투어+사진 촬영 원하시는 분들께 추천합니다!”</p>

                    <p class="review-text">“Hossam is simply the best. Why? Because he is very kind, very knowledgeable and truly loves his culture and his country. I had the privilege of spending a day and half with Hossam on a private tour. He went above and beyond to ensure I was happy, safe and at ease. This is no doubt Hossam is one of the best guides I’ve ever had. Thank you for showing me the best of Cairo and for creating an unforgettable experience I will treasure for many more years to come.”</p>
